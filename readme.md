# Code Classifier
## About

It classifies C code to determine whether it was generated by human or AI! This was my computer science project done for my CIS 4900 - computer science project.

## Basic Usage

This is run in multiple steps.

### Dataset retrieval and preparation

Datasets are not included as part of this repository, but they can be retrieved from their respective sites:
- [Project Codenet](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/project-codenet/)
- [Plagiarism Dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/programming-homework-dataset-plagiarism-detection)

These must be extracted to their respective folders in `datasets/`.
The notebooks in `notebooks/` provide the code to extract the data into the proper pickle file structures.

### Running

- `code_generator`: Generate AI Code from Programming Problems(Optional)
- `merge_data`: Merge separate datasets into final datasets for processing
- `generate_embeddings`: Convert datasets into embeddings
- `hyperparameter_tuning`: Generate hyperparameters for a given dataset for a detector
- `test_embedding`: Run code detector
