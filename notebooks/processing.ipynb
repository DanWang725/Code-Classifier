      "\n",
      "In this assignment, you will develop a C program to evaluate the grades of three students - Tarik, Bojan, and Mirza. The program should take the scores for each student in several subjects (two partial exams, attendance, assignments, and final exam) as input from the user and calculate the overall grade for each student based on the following criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Partial exams: 0-20 points\n",
      "* Attendance: 0-10 points\n",
      "* Assignments: 0-10 points\n",
      "* Final exam: 0-40 points\n",

      "1. Understand how to use input/output functions in C (e.g., `scanf`, `printf`) to read user input and display output.\n",
      "2. Develop a program that can handle invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric characters) and provide informative error messages.\n",

      "4. Calculate and compare overall grades for multiple students.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Your program should be written in C and named `student_grades.c`.\n",
      "2. The program should take input from the user using `scanf` and display output using `printf`.\n",
      "3. You should handle invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric characters) by displaying an error message and exiting the program.\n",
      "4. Your program should calculate the overall grade for each student based on the provided grading criteria.\n",
      "5. The program should determine whether any or all of the students have passed, and if so, whether they have achieved the same grade.\n",

      "### Hints\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use arrays to store the input scores for each subject.\n",
      "* Implement a loop to calculate the overall grade for each student.\n",
      "* Use conditional statements to check the validity of user input and handle errors.\n",
      "* Consider using functions to separate the calculation of individual grades from the main program logic.\n",

      "Okay, I need to write a C program for evaluating the grades of three students: Tarik, Bojan, and Mirza. The program should take their scores from several subjects as input and calculate their overall grades based on specific criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me understand the problem. Each student has four components contributing to their grade:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Partial exams: 0-20 points\n",
      "- Attendance: 0-10 points\n",
      "- Assignments: 0-10 points\n",
      "- Final exam: 0-40 points\n",
      "\n",
      "The total possible score is 20 + 10 + 10 + 40 = 80. So the overall grade is calculated by summing these components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but how exactly are the grades determined? I think each student's total will determine their grade. But what's the passing criteria? The problem says to determine if they passed and whether they have the same grade. Hmm, maybe the passing is based on a certain threshold, like 50% or more of the total possible points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me check: 80 is the maximum. So 50 would be 62.5? Or perhaps each component has its own weight. Wait no, the problem says to calculate the overall grade by summing all components. So for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall = partial + attendance + assignments + final.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, based on that total, determine if they passed and what their grade is.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the question doesn't specify how the overall score translates into a letter grade (like A, B, etc.), but it does say to determine whether any or all have passed. So perhaps passing is simply having an overall score above a certain threshold, maybe 50% of 80 which is 40? Or wait, no—maybe each component's maximum adds up to 80, so the passing could be based on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify what constitutes a pass. Hmm, perhaps I need to assume that any total above zero means they passed, or maybe there's a specific cutoff like 50 points out of 80 (which is 62.5%—wait no, 50/80 is 62.5%). Or maybe the passing grade is 40 points? Because 40 is the maximum for the final exam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says to determine whether they have passed and if so, whether their grades are the same. So perhaps passing is simply having an overall score that meets or exceeds a certain threshold, like 50 points (since 80 is total). Or maybe each component's contribution determines the grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no—the problem doesn't specify any thresholds for letter grades, only to calculate the overall and determine pass/fail. So perhaps passing is simply having an overall score above zero? That can't be right because all students would pass unless they have zero in all components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the passing criteria is based on each component's contribution. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Partial exams: 0-20\n",
      "- Attendance: up to 10 points (so max 10)\n",
      "- Assignments: same as attendance.\n",
      "- Final exam: up to 40.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps the overall score is calculated, and if it's above a certain threshold like 50% of 80 (which is 40), then they pass. Or maybe each component has its own weight in terms of percentages towards the final grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify any weights beyond their point values. So perhaps the overall score is simply the sum of all points, and passing is determined by whether that sum meets a certain threshold, like 50% (40 points) or higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the problem says to determine if they passed, I think it's safe to assume that any total >= 50 would be a pass. Or perhaps each component contributes as per their maximum:\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The program should calculate the overall grade for each student based on the criteria given. Then determine whether any or all have passed and if so, same grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps are: read input for each student's four scores, compute the sum (overall), then decide pass/fail, and compare their grades.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to translate the total into a grade? The problem doesn't specify letter grades but just says \"achieved the same grade.\" So perhaps the overall score is considered as the 'grade,' so if two students have the same total, they have the same grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that makes sense. So each student's overall is their numerical grade, and we compare these numbers to see if any or all are the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Tarik has 70 points.\n",
      "- Bojan has 70.\n",
      "- Mirza has 65.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Tarik and Bojan have the same grade, while Mirza doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, what about passing? The program should determine whether any or all passed. So perhaps a student passes if their overall is above a certain threshold, say 50 points (since 80 is total). Or maybe it's based on each component's contribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that as long as the sum is positive, they pass. But that seems unlikely because even with minimal scores, like partial exams=1, attendance=1, etc., the sum would be more than zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in reality, passing usually requires meeting a certain standard. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that any overall score is considered as passed, and the grade is just the numerical value.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each student:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Read four scores: partial exams (0-20), attendance (0-10), assignments (0-10), final exam (0-40).\n",
      "- Sum them to get the total.\n",
      "- Then, determine if they passed. But since no threshold is given, perhaps passing is simply having a positive total? Or maybe it's based on each component.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \"determine whether any or all of the students have passed.\" So I think that implies there's a specific condition for passing. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that passing is when the sum is >= 50 (since 80 is total, 50 is more than half). Or maybe it's based on each component.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps each component has its own pass criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Partial exams: must be at least a certain score.\n",
      "- Attendance: must be above a threshold.\n",
      "- Assignments: same as attendance.\n",
      "- Final exam: must be above a certain score.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem doesn't specify any of that. So I think it's safer to assume that passing is based on the overall sum being >= 50 points (since 80 is total, 50 is 62.5% which is a common pass threshold).\n",
      "\n",
      "So for each student:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Calculate their total as partial + attendance + assignments + final.\n",
      "- If total >= 50: passed\n",
      "- Else: failed\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, compare the totals of all three students to see if any have the same grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the problem says \"if they have achieved the same grade.\" So perhaps the grade is determined by their overall score. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "If two students have the same total, they have the same grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Read input for each student's four scores.\n",
      "2. Calculate the sum (overall) for each.\n",
      "3. Determine if each passed or failed based on sum >= 50.\n",
      "4. Compare the sums to see if any two or all three are equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the problem says \"achieved the same grade,\" perhaps it refers to their overall numerical score, regardless of pass/fail status.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, how to structure the code:\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to read data for three students. Each has four integers: partial, attendance, assignments, final.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each student, sum these four numbers to get the total.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, check if any two or all three have the same total.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, determine which students passed (sum >=50) and which failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in code:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Read three sets of four integers.\n",
      "- For each set, compute sum.\n",
      "- Store sums in an array or variables.\n",
      "- Compare the sums to see duplicates.\n",
      "- Also, for each student, check if sum >=50: mark as pass or fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how to read input? The problem says \"write the C code,\" but it's not specified whether the input is from a file or stdin. So I'll assume that we're reading from standard input.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in C:\n",
      "\n",
      "We can have three variables for each student's data, perhaps structs or separate arrays.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since there are only three students, perhaps using an array of structs would be manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each struct could contain four integers: partial, attendance, assignments, final.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, we can read each student's data one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Include necessary headers: #include <stdio.h>\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Read three students' data:\n",
      "\n",
      "   For i from 0 to 2:\n",
      "      Read four integers into variables.\n",
      "      Compute sum = partial + attendance + assignments + final.\n",
      "      Store sum in an array, say sums[i].\n",
      "\n",
      "3. After reading all three, check for duplicates in the sums array.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Also, determine pass/fail for each student: if sums[i] >=50, passed else failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how to implement step 2:\n",
      "\n",
      "We can have a loop that runs three times, each time reading four integers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In code:\n",
      "\n",
      "int sums[3];\n",
      "for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n",
      "    int partial, attendance, assignments, final;\n",
      "    printf(\"Enter data for student %d:\\n\", i+1);\n",
      "    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &partial, &attendance, &assignments, &final);\n",
      "    sums[i] = partial + attendance + assignments + final;\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in C, the variables inside the loop are reinitialized each time, so that's fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps using a struct:\n",
      "\n",
      "struct Student {\n",
      "    int partial;\n",
      "    int attendance;\n",
      "    int assignments;\n",
      "    int final;\n",
      "};\n",
      "\n",
      "struct Student students[3];\n",
      "\n",
      "for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n",
      "    printf(\"Enter data for student %d:\\n\", i+1);\n",
      "    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &students[i].partial, &students[i].attendance, \n",
      "           &students[i].assignments, &students[i].final);\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Then compute sums:\n",
      "\n",
      "int sums[3];\n",
      "for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n",
      "    sums[i] = students[i].partial + students[i].attendance + students[i].assignments + students[i].final;\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "But using a struct might be overkill for just three students, but it's manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps just read each student's data into four variables and compute the sum on the fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, after computing sums, we need to check:\n",
      "\n",
      "- How many students passed (sum >=50)\n",
      "- Whether any two or all have the same sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "So first, for pass/fail:\n",
      "\n",
      "int passed[3];\n",
      "for (i=0; i<3; i++) {\n",
      "    if (sums[i] >= 50) {\n",
      "        passed[i] = 1;\n",
      "    } else {\n",
      "        passed[i] = 0;\n",
      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, check for duplicates in sums.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can compare each pair:\n",
      "\n",
      "if (sums[0] == sums[1]) || (sums[0] == sums[2]) || (sums[1] == sums[2])) {\n",
      "    // there are duplicates\n",
      "} else {\n",
      "    // all unique\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says \"achieved the same grade,\" so perhaps we need to report which students have the same sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in code, after computing sums:\n",
      "\n",
      "Check each pair and print accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "if (sums[0] == sums[1]) {\n",
      "    printf(\"Student 1 and Student 2 have the same grade.\\n\");\n",
      "}\n",
      "if (sums[0] == sums[2]) {\n",
      "    printf(\"Student 1 and Student 3 have the same grade.\\n\");\n",
      "}\n",
      "if (sums[1] == sums[2]) {\n",
      "    printf(\"Student 2 and Student 3 have the same grade.\\n\");\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "But this could result in multiple messages if all three are equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, we can find how many unique sums there are.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all three are the same: only one message.\n",
      "\n",
      "Else, check pairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "The code outline is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Read three students' data.\n",
      "- Compute their total scores.\n",
      "- Determine pass/fail for each.\n",
      "- Check for duplicate totals and report accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, perhaps print out each student's data and whether they passed or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the complete code could look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "#include <stdio.h>\n",
      "\n",
      "int main() {\n",
